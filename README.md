# 🩺 Diabetes Classification

This project uses Machine Learning models to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health data.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Diabetes-Classification.ipynb` → Main Jupyter Notebook with the code.
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies (install before running).
- `dataset.csv` → Dataset used for training and testing (not uploaded here, please download separately).

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pglava7-oss/Diabetes-Classification.git
cd Diabetes-Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage
Open the notebook in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook Diabetes-Classification.ipynb
```

## 📊 Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

## 📌 Notes
- Dataset used: **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** (available on Kaggle/Scikit-learn).  
- Accuracy and results may vary based on preprocessing and parameters.
